Yes—those two flows capture the distinction we need. In brief:

⸻

Scenario 1 (Lookup Consumed Offshore)
	1.	A foreign client of Sinch sends an A2P/SMS destined for the Philippines.
	2.	Sinch’s foreign system calls Syn PH’s QNPDB in Makati/Clark to retrieve the correct LRN.
	3.	The QNPDB response is returned directly to Sinch’s servers abroad (no intermediate Philippine hand‑off).
	4.	Sinch then uses that LRN—on its foreign infrastructure—to route the SMS to the appropriate Philippine operator.
	5.	The operator delivers the message to the Philippine end‑user.

Key point: The lookup result is consumed entirely in Sinch’s foreign network before any traffic enters a Philippine telco.

⸻

Scenario 2 (Lookup Consumed in PH)
	1.	A foreign client of Sinch sends an A2P/SMS destined for the Philippines.
	2.	Sinch’s foreign system queries Syn PH’s QNPDB, but the response is immediately handed off (or kept) within a Philippine‑based gateway/stack.
	3.	From that Philippine gateway, Syn PH (or a local partner) applies the LRN and delivers the SMS to the correct Philippine operator.
	4.	The operator then delivers the message to the Philippine end‑user.

Key point: The lookup result is applied (and the routing decision made) within the Philippine network before the SMS reaches the local operator.

Use these two scenarios to confirm:
	•	In Scenario 1, “use/consumption” of the lookup happens entirely outside the Philippines (supporting a zero‑rating argument).
	•	In Scenario 2, the lookup is consumed within the Philippines (making it a domestically taxed service).

Once the technical manager confirms which of these maps to our actual flow, we’ll know whether the lookup truly qualifies as “exported” or must be treated as a Philippine‑sourced/ VATable service.
