## Financial Data Storage Requirements Summary

### **By Country:**

• **Denmark**: 5 years retention + **mandatory backup on EU/EEA server**
• **Germany**: 10 years retention + GoBD compliance + EU/EEA storage allowed with immediate tax authority access
• **Luxembourg**: 10 years retention + no strict localization but must ensure immediate authority access
• **Netherlands**: 7 years retention (10 for real estate) + EU storage permitted

### **EMEA Data Center Question:**

• **✅ EMEA within EU/EEA is compliant** for all countries
• **❌ EMEA outside EU/EEA would NOT meet Denmark’s requirements** and creates complexity for others
• **Recommendation**: Prioritize EU/EEA data centers only

### **Next Steps:**

• **Denmark has the strictest requirement** (mandatory EU/EEA backup)
• **Key consideration**: Ensure immediate audit access for all tax authorities
• **CTIO should verify**: Current backup locations and confirm EU/EEA compliance

**Bottom line**: EU/EEA data centers are compliant, but avoid non-EU EMEA locations due to Denmark’s explicit restrictions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
